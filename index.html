	<h1>CHAPTER 4:Decisions and Loops</h1>
	<div class= "border">
		<h3 class= "greeting">Decision Making</h3>

		<p class= "bold">Using flowcharts can help when determining which code to run.</p>
		<div class= "border">
			True/False Operator Example: JS Line 2
			<p>Speed Limit: 60</p>
			<p>Current Speed: 66</p>
			<p><span id="quickExample"></span></p>
			<p>Over the limit Ticket (no more than 5 mph):<span id= "ticketed"></span></p>
		</div>
		<p>Operands does not have to be a single value, it can also be an expression. 
			<p>((speed1 + speed2) == (limit1 + limit2))
		<ul>
			<h4>Logical Operators</h4>
			<li>"&&" Ex at Line 32: At least both values must be met to return true</li>
			<li>"||" Ex at line 34 : At least one of values must be met to return true</li>
			<li>"!" Ex at line 35: Logical NOT, reverses/inverts boolean value</li>
			<p>Logical expressions are evaluated left to right. If first condition is met, then there is no need to go to the second condition</p>
		</ul>
		<div> 
			<h4 class= "greeting">IF Statements Ex: Line 45</h4>
			<p class= "bold">If condition results to "true". It will execute code inside {....} curly braces.</p>
			<p> The if - else statement: If the "if" statement returns false, the else statement is executed</p>

			<h4 class= "greeting">SWITCH Statements Ex: Line 55</h4>
			<p> Starts with a switch value, for that value, a switch statement can be created and code can be run when that value is met.</p>
			<p> Each case statment has to be ended with a 'break;' keyword to tell the interpreter to finish and proceed to whatever code outside of the switch statement.</p>

			<h4 class="bold">if....else vs switch ... case Statements:</h4>
			<p>Switch statements has a default option and is faster to execute than the if statement.</p>
			<p>if statements all statements are checked unlike switch statements, which makes it slower than the latter</p>

			<h4>Type Coercion & Weak Typing EX: Line 72</h4>
			<p>Type Coercion: Converts data to complete an operation EX: '1' > 0 returns true, '1' == 1</p>
			<p>Weak typing: data type of values can change</p>
			<p>Strong Typing: data type needs to be specified</p>
			<p>To avoid type coercion errors, use STRICT operators like '===, !==,' and not '==, !=' (NaN stands for Not a Number)
			
			<h4>Truthy & Falsy Values: Page 167</h4>
			<p>Due to Coercion, every value in JS can be treated as if they are true/false.</p>
			<p>Falsy: values that are treated as if it were false</p>
			<p>Truthy: almost anything that is NOT a falsy is a truthy. The presence of arrays & objects are also considred a truthy, common when checking for presence of an element in a page</p>
			<p><b>Unary Operator:</b> Returns a result with one operand</p>
			<p><b>Short Circuit Values: </b>Logical Operators are processed left-right, they short circuit as soon as they have a result. Returns value of what stopped the procecessing, not a boolean.</p>

				<h3>LOOPS</h3>
				<b>Example Code @ Line 72</b>
				<br>
				<b>Important Concepts:</b>
				<p>Break(break;): Ends loop & continues code outside of that loop</p>
				<p>Continue(continue;): tells loop to stop current interation & update and check condition again. if true, runs the code again.</p>
				<p>Loops and Arrays go well together</p>
				<p>Loops can slow down browsers if loop contains alot of items. Avoid infinite loops by placing variables outside of the loop because it will change values inside that loop and will break the script.
					<ol>
						<li><b>For Loop w/ Array</b>
							<p>Often used to loop through arrays</p>
							<p>EX @ Line 78</p>
							<span id= "forLoop"></span>
						</li>
						<br>
						<li><b>While Loop</b>
							<p>EX @ Line 93</p>
							<p>Example used is better used for "for" loop, this loop is better used when you don't know how many times a code should run but want to as long as the condition is met</p>
							<span id= "whileLoop"></span>
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Do...While Loop</b>
							<p>Difference w/ the while loop is that the code block comes before the condition which means that the code is run at least ONCE</p>
							<p>EX @ Line 103</p>
							<p>Initial # of 10,000 divided by 10 untill i is less than 10</p>
							<span id= "doWhileLoop"></span>
						</li>

	<h1>Chapter 5: The DOM(Document Object Model)</h1>
	<div class= "border">
		<p class= "bold">The DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page, how to access JS & update contents of the page on the browser window.</p>
		<p>The DOM defines methods & properties to access/update objects in this model</p>
		<p>Commonly called by people as an API(Application Programming Interface)</p>
		<div class= "border">
			<p><b>DOM TREE:</b>The DOM specifies how a page is structured using the DOM TREE model, this model is made outta objects</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><b>The Document Node:</b>Represents every element, attribute and piece of text in the HTML page.</p>
					<p>It is the starting point for access into the DOM tree</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><b>Element Node:</b>Describes the structure of an HTML page</p>
					<p>Ex: The "h1, h2, p," tags inside <....></p>
					<p>Used to specifically find a target or access elements inside the DOM tree</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
