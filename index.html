	<h1>CHAPTER 4:Decisions and Loops</h1>
	<div class= "border">
		<h3 class= "greeting">Decision Making</h3>

		<p class= "bold">Using flowcharts can help when determining which code to run.</p>
		<div class= "border">
			True/False Operator Example: JS Line 2
			<p>Speed Limit: 60</p>
			<p>Current Speed: 66</p>
			<p><span id="quickExample"></span></p>
			<p>Over the limit Ticket (no more than 5 mph):<span id= "ticketed"></span></p>
		</div>
		<p>Operands does not have to be a single value, it can also be an expression. 
			<p>((speed1 + speed2) == (limit1 + limit2))
		<ul>
			<h4>Logical Operators</h4>
			<li>"&&" Ex at Line 32: At least both values must be met to return true</li>
			<li>"||" Ex at line 34 : At least one of values must be met to return true</li>
			<li>"!" Ex at line 35: Logical NOT, reverses/inverts boolean value</li>
			<p>Logical expressions are evaluated left to right. If first condition is met, then there is no need to go to the second condition</p>
		</ul>
		<div> 
			<h4 class= "greeting">IF Statements Ex: Line 45</h4>
			<p class= "bold">If condition results to "true". It will execute code inside {....} curly braces.</p>
			<p> The if - else statement: If the "if" statement returns false, the else statement is executed</p>

			<h4 class= "greeting">SWITCH Statements Ex: Line 55</h4>
			<p> Starts with a switch value, for that value, a switch statement can be created and code can be run when that value is met.</p>
			<p> Each case statment has to be ended with a 'break;' keyword to tell the interpreter to finish and proceed to whatever code outside of the switch statement.</p>

			<h4 class="bold">if....else vs switch ... case Statements:</h4>
			<p>Switch statements has a default option and is faster to execute than the if statement.</p>
			<p>if statements all statements are checked unlike switch statements, which makes it slower than the latter</p>

			<h4>Type Coercion & Weak Typing EX: Line 72</h4>
			<p>Type Coercion: Converts data to complete an operation EX: '1' > 0 returns true, '1' == 1</p>
			<p>Weak typing: data type of values can change</p>
			<p>Strong Typing: data type needs to be specified</p>
			<p>To avoid type coercion errors, use STRICT operators like '===, !==,' and not '==, !=' (NaN stands for Not a Number)
			
			<h4>Truthy & Falsy Values: Page 167</h4>
			<p>Due to Coercion, every value in JS can be treated as if they are true/false.</p>
			<p>Falsy: values that are treated as if it were false</p>
			<p>Truthy: almost anything that is NOT a falsy is a truthy. The presence of arrays & objects are also considred a truthy, common when checking for presence of an element in a page</p>
			<p><b>Unary Operator:</b> Returns a result with one operand</p>
			<p><b>Short Circuit Values: </b>Logical Operators are processed left-right, they short circuit as soon as they have a result. Returns value of what stopped the procecessing, not a boolean.</p>
